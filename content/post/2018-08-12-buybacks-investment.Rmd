Tax cuts have led to a surge in buybacks and a fall in tax revenues from corporations.



``` {r include = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

plot <- read_xls("buyback.xls")

accumulate_by <- function(dat, var) {
  var <- lazyeval::f_eval(var, dat)
  lvls <- plotly:::getLevels(var)
  dats <- lapply(seq_along(lvls), function(x) {
    cbind(dat[var %in% lvls[seq(1, x)], ], frame = lvls[[x]])
  })
  dplyr::bind_rows(dats)
}

f <- plot %>%
  accumulate_by(~observation_date)

d <- ggplot(f, aes(observation_date, frame = frame)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = buybacks, colour = "buybacks"), size = 1) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = corporate_tax_income, colour = "corporate_tax_income"), size = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(plot$observation_date[20])) 

p <- ggplotly(d) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Percentage change in buybacks and corporate tax income",
    yaxis = list(
      title = "Percentage Change",
      zeroline = F,
      tickprefix = "$"
    ),
    xaxis = list(
      title = "Date",
      zeroline = F, 
      showgrid = F
    )
  ) %>% 
  animation_opts(
    frame = 100, 
    transition = 0, 
    redraw = FALSE
  ) %>%
  animation_slider(
    currentvalue = list(
      prefix = "Date"

Corporate tax cuts are supposed to lead to higher business [investment](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-11-17/yes-a-corporate-tax-cut-would-increase-investment) but instead thereâ€™s claims that companies are foregoing investment and using the extra cash to buyback their [shares](http://theweek.com/articles/787966/ban-share-buybacks?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter). Indeed, growth in business investment since the tax cuts has been tepid.
