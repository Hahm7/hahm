<p>Imagine we find a habitable planet next to our nearest star which wasn’t the sun. That would be Proxima Centauri and it is approximately 4.2 light years away from us. What follows next is a gross oversimplification of space travel. If we assume humans could travel through space at a speed of 56,000 km/h, it would take 81,000 years to reach the planet. We of course decide to colonise it but we can’t live for 81,000 years — the current world average life expectancy is 70.5 years. So, let’s assume our next best idea is to go there by using a generational ship, where this ship would sustain humans for generations until the destination is reached. Those aboard the ship will live and die on it, giving birth to the next generation along the way until the final generation reaches the planet.</p>
<p>Would we do it?</p>
<p>81,000 years is obviously a long time and the first humans going aboard the generational ship are making choices based on their current technology. What if 43,587 years later, those back on earth discover new technology which would allow them to colonise the planet within 20 years. The offspring of those humans who boarded the generational ship would not reach the planet first, which was the main reason to go on the ship. With this in mind, would anyone choose to board the ship in the first place?</p>
<p>This is the same problem with investment. It takes time for the benefits to show and in that time, it can be rendered useless by new technology. Could this sort of thinking be discouraging businesses from investments?</p>
<div id="why-is-investment-important" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Why is investment important?</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Investment is central to the functioning of any economy. The process of committing time, resources, and money so that we can produce useful things in the future is, from an economic point of view, a defining part of what businesses, governments, and individuals do.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s from Jonathan Haskel’s and Stian Westlake’s book <em>Capitalism without Capital</em>. Investment is what allows me to write this post on a laptop instead on pen and paper. It’s what allows me to research this topic on the internet instead of drudging away in the library, sifting through a mountain of books. It’s also what allows you to read this post in your home, place of work or on public transportation without carrying around pieces of paper.</p>
<p>Investment helps raise an economy’s capital stock, which is another way of saying it increases the number of tools we can work with. These new tools and technologies make an impact on our productivity — how much we’re able to get done with the same amount of inputs. This includes investment in education where knowing more allows you to do more or do things in a better way.</p>
<p>As a component of GDP, measuring investment helps us to measure an economy’s output. It’s the most volatile component as the animation below shows, it rises and falls by larger amounts based on how optimistic firms are about the future.</p>
<p><img src="/images/volatile.gif" /></p>
<p>Part of this volatility is due to investment being optional. You need to buy food and pay for shelter regularly to sustain yourself but you don’t need to buy, for example, a new machinery for your business or learn a certain skill if you think it’s going to be worthless in the future. Even if you plan to invest, future outcomes are uncertain. With the gains of investments being realised in the long term, it’s not a surprise that investment activity is sensitive to this uncertainty.</p>

<h3><strong>What’s happening to investment now?</strong></h3>
<p>In my previous <a href="https://hahm.netlify.com/buybacks-investment/">post</a>, I looked at whether buybacks were linked to the sluggish investment in United States, where I concluded that buybacks were not the main driver. The United States was the focus of the post because that’s where most of the claims against buybacks have come from. So, if buybacks aren’t behind sluggish investment, what could be? A natural place to start is to see if funding an investment is expensive. Long run real interest rates have been trending downwards and have reached all-time lows in recent years.</p>

<p>It should have been cheaper to finance investment for businesses in the last 20 years but we have not seen an uptick in investment. What if there’s nothing worth investing in?</p>
